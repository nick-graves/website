Avera St. Luke’s Hospital, in collaboration with Dakota Pulmonary, is at the forefront of lung cancer care with our new robotic bronchoscopy program. This innovative program allows for minimally invasive, robotic-assisted procedures that significantly improve early detection and treatment of lung cancer.

### Meet Our Leader
Dr. Deptmer Ashley, MD, leads our program. With training from The University of Texas and experience at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Ashley brings expertise in robotic-assisted bronchoscopy to Avera St. Luke’s. His work has already led to the early detection of stage one lung cancers, providing patients with a 90% five-year survivability rate.

### Our Technology
We use the Ion system developed by Intuitive, pioneers in robotic-assisted surgery. This technology allows us to access remote lung tissue that conventional bronchoscopy cannot reach, ensuring accurate and early diagnosis.

### Our Mission
Lung cancer remains a significant public health concern, with a new diagnosis every 2.5 minutes in the United States. Nearly half of these cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. At Avera St. Luke’s, our mission is to change this statistic through:

- **Early Detection:** Encouraging low-dose CT lung cancer screenings for individuals aged 50-77 with a history of smoking.
- **Prompt Treatment:** Reducing the average detection-to-treatment timeframe from seven months to seven days.

### Our Impact
With our program, patients experience a swift transition from detection to diagnosis to treatment, often within a week. This rapid turnaround time significantly impacts patient outcomes and peace of mind.
