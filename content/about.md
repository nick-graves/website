Dakota Pulmonary, in collaboration with Avera St. Luke’s Hospital, is at the forefront of lung care with our new robotic bronchoscopy program. This innovative program allows for minimally invasive, robotic-assisted procedures that significantly improve early detection and treatment of lung conditions.

### Our Background
Deptmer Ashley, MD, founder of the program has trained at The University of Texas with experience at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Dr. Ashley brings his mastery in interventional pulmonology to Dakota Pulmonary where his work has already led to the early detection of stage one lung cancers, providing patients with a 90% five-year survivability rate. Dr. Ashley is also very capable of diagnosing and treating other major lung conditions such as emphysema and COPD, faster than anyone has seen before. 

### Our Technology
Dakota Pulmonary is the absolute forefront of interventional pulmonology tech. We use the Ion system developed by Intuitive, pioneers in robotic-assisted surgery which allows us to access remote lung tissue that conventional bronchoscopy cannot reach, ensuring accurate and early diagnosis that we have never seen before. Much of the technology we use for COPD such as stents, valves, rigid tube procedures, debulking, and post electric field tech, is the standard, plus more. 

### Our Mission
Lung care remains a significant public health concern, with a new diagnosis every 2.5 minutes in the United States. Nearly half of these cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. At Avera St. Luke’s, our mission is to change this statistic through:

- **Early Detection:** Encouraging low-dose CT screening for lung cancer, potential COPD treatment, or emphysema, for individuals aged 50-77 with a history of smoking.
- **Prompt Treatment:** Reducing the average detection-to-treatment timeframe from seven months to seven days, and in some cases, as little as 18 hours. 

### Our Impact
With our program, patients experience a swift transition from detection to diagnosis to treatment, often within a week. This rapid turnaround time significantly impacts patient outcomes and peace of mind.
