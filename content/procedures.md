{{< procedure-box title="Electrocautery and Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC)" id="electrocautery-and-argon-plasma-coagulation">}}
Electrocautery, also known as electrosurgery, is a technique that uses electrical currents to cut or coagulate tissue during medical procedures. In the context of bronchoscopic procedures, electrocautery is used to manage and treat various airway conditions, including tumors, bleeding, and obstruction. Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) is a specialized form of electrosurgery that uses ionized argon gas to coagulate and manage tissue in the airways. It is often used for treating bleeding, tumors, and other airway abnormalities.

{{< procedure-box title="Microdebrider Bronchoscopy" id="microdebrider-bronchoscopy">}}
Microdebrider bronchoscopy is a procedure that combines bronchoscopy with a microdebrider tool to remove or shave off abnormal tissue from the airways. This technique is often used to treat conditions such as obstructive lesions, tumors, or excessive granulation tissue in the airways.
{{< /procedure-box >}}

{{< procedure-box title="Pulsed Electrical Field Therapy" id="pulsed-electrical-field-therapy">}}
Pulsed Electrical Field Therapy (PEFT) is a medical treatment that uses short bursts of electrical energy to treat abnormal or diseased tissue. In the context of airway management, PEFT is employed to target and treat various conditions, such as tumors, pre-cancerous lesions, and other abnormal growths within the airways.

## Pleural Procedures

{{< procedure-box title="Thoracentesis" id="thoracentesis">}}
Thoracentesis is a medical procedure used to remove excess fluid from the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall. This procedure is often performed to relieve symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain caused by fluid accumulation (pleural effusion) and to analyze the fluid for diagnostic purposes.
{{< /procedure-box >}}

{{< procedure-box title="Pleurodesis" id="pleurodesis">}}
Pleurodesis is a medical procedure designed to prevent the recurrence of pleural effusion (fluid accumulation between the lungs and chest wall) or pneumothorax (air in the pleural space) by creating a permanent adhesion between the pleurae (the two layers of tissue surrounding the lungs). This adhesion helps to eliminate the pleural space and prevent further fluid or air accumulation.

{{< procedure-box title="Indwelling Pleural Catheter (IPC) Placement" id="indwelling-pleural-catheter-placement">}}
Indwelling Pleural Catheter (IPC) placement is a procedure used to manage recurrent pleural effusion (fluid accumulation between the lungs and chest wall) by inserting a long-term catheter that allows for continuous or intermittent drainage of fluid. This method provides symptomatic relief and helps to avoid frequent, invasive procedures.
{{< /procedure-box >}}

{{< procedure-box title="Medical Thoracoscopy/Pleuroscopy" id="medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy">}}
Medical thoracoscopy, also known as pleuroscopy, is a minimally invasive procedure used to examine the pleural space (the area between the lungs and the chest wall) and perform diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. This procedure allows physicians to visualize and access the pleural cavity for the evaluation of pleural diseases, including effusions, infections, and tumors.
{{< /procedure-box >}}

{{< procedure-box title="Pleural Biopsy" id="pleural-biopsy">}}
A pleural biopsy is a procedure in which a small sample of tissue from the pleura (the lining of the lungs and chest cavity) is collected for examination. This procedure is often used to diagnose conditions affecting the pleura, such as infections, tumors, or inflammatory diseases. It can provide crucial information about the underlying cause of pleural abnormalities or fluid accumulation.
